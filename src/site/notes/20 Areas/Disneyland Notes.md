# Summary

## Plan ahead
- Buy things ahead of trip to avoid buying from Disney
	- Autograph book and pen
	- Mickey/Minnie ears
- Install Disneyland app
- Buy tickets for the days you are going as they can be sold-out
	- Genie pass is well worth it even though it does not cover all the rides
- Pack comfortable walking shoes (we did around 15k steps all the days)
- Bring a stroller for even older kids; with the long queues and long days gives them a place to rest all day. 
- Hopper pass is useful if you have limited time and want to visit both Disney and California adventure
## During visit
- Stayed at Marriott Anaheim across from Disneyland with Panera Bread in the front
- Queues are less 8 to 10 in the morning or 9 to 12 at close (when they are open until 12 at night). we went in late and stayed until closing
- If everyone in the family is not interested in the same rides
	- Book the same ride with multiple genie passes, you can do the same ride multiple times 
	- You can split half of the family into one ride and other half in other ride
- Map in the app shows where the characters are active.
- Book your food in the app to avoid the long lines for food
- You can take food with you to save money
- If you want to do breakfast with characters they are much cheaper in the Disneyland hotel that you can get to without ticket.
- Genie pass gets you free photos around the park; look for the photographers with vest and SLRs. 
	- Although no way to download photos in bulk in the app; supposedly website has, but I couldn't link our ID
- Carry powerbank for the phone; app and phone must have.
- Fireworks was less crowded from near It's a small world (and also had additional display on the walls of small world)
- Train around the park is a practical option to reduce walking.

## Good rides (for me)

Rocketship
Space mountain
Big thunder rail road
Stroller coaster (by me)
Autopia (for smaller kids)
Bob sled
Indiana jones
smugglers run
Incredi coaster

## Good shows
world of Color in California adventure; worth the money to get seats

Fireworks from near It's a small world

## Dud rides (for me)

Paying for front row for the parade because we still had to line up
